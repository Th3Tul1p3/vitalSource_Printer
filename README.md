# vitalSourcePrinter

Simple POC to automate the pdf printing of book in Vital Source application. This script was made in the purpose to print, for example, a complete chapter to an single pdf file. 
This script is not intended to be a clean program that handles every cases and/or every problems. 
To print around 1500 pages, a lot of time is needed, around 15 hours. During the execution of the program, the computer can not be used for an other task. 
I hope this project, will help you. 

1. open one window of Vital source application with the book you want to print
2. Run the script and fill in the needed fields. 

# Known issues
Sometimes, for some unexplained reasons, Vital Source crash. Close the application, reopen it and rerun the script.
